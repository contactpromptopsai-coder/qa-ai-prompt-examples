# QA AI Prompts

## Why this repository exists

These examples show **how** AI can be used in QA,
but they intentionally cover only a small part of real QA workflows.

In real projects, the challenge is not a single prompt,
but having **the right prompt at the right moment**:
- during requirement analysis
- while designing tests
- when reviewing automation code
- when debugging failures

That gap is what the full PromptOps toolkit is designed to solve.
